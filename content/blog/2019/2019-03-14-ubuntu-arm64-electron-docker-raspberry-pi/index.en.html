    How to run containerized <a href="https://electronjs.org/" target="_blank">electron</a> app on a Raspberry Pi using ARM64 architecture? With Ubuntu!
</p>
<!--more-->
<p class="paragraph">
    I have been a long time fan of <a href="https://electronjs.org/" target="_blank">electron</a>. It is a tool with which you can
    "Build cross platform desktop apps with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS". I was really excited when I finally realized
    that there is a <a href="https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-packager" target="_blank">packager</a> for electron and even
    more so for the <a href="https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-installer-debian" target="_blank">debian installer</a>
</p>

<p class="paragraph">
    I've had good experience with running electron on Raspberry Pi in the past, and it was time to do something with it again.
</p>

<p class="paragraph">
    I have a few Raspberry Pi 3 Model B lying around and this is a guide specifically for Model B. I would really appreciate if someone can tell
    <a href="mailto:antti@virrat.hacklab.fi">me</a> if you can get this to work with B+ and A+ as well! I also have a couple of official
    Raspberry Pi 7" touchscreen displays in my disposal so we use one of those as well.

</div>

<h3 id="start" class="header in-between">Let's get started</h3>

<p class="paragraph">
    <a href="https://wiki.ubuntu.com/ARM/RaspberryPi" target="_blank">Ubuntu Wiki</a> has a dedicated page for Raspberry Pi and they're providing
    a very convenient image with preinstalled 18.04 LTS server for Raspberry Pi Model 3 B/B+:
    <a href="http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/releases/bionic/release/ubuntu-18.04.2-preinstalled-server-arm64+raspi3.img.xz" target="_blank">ubuntu-18.04.2-preinstalled-server-arm64+raspi3.img.xz</a>
    (4G image, 419MB compressed)
</p>

<p class="paragraph">
    To get this image into an SD-card, I like to use <a href="https://www.balena.io/etcher/" target="_blank">BalenaEtcher</a>
    (it is actually built with Electron as well), which get's the job done without any extra fuzz or learning command-line tools. I use macOS for my
    day-to-day activities, but because of Electron, they have packaged it to other platforms as well.
    <img src="balena_etcher.png" width="100%" />
    It's as easy as 1-2-3. Select an image (you don't even need to decompress it first), select the SD-card and click Flash!
</p>

<p class="paragraph">
    Now, if you have a display and want to utilize it from the beginning, we need to do one thing first. When you open up the contents of the SD-card
    we just made, you will see something like this:
    <img src="system-boot.png" width="100%" />
    We are interested in config.txt which looks like this:
    <pre>
        <code class="plaintext">
    enable_uart=1
    kernel=kernel8.bin
    device_tree_address=0x03000000
    dtparam=i2c_arm=on
    dtparam=spi=on
    arm_64bit=1
        </code>
    </pre>
    <p class="paragraph">
        Before we boot the thing, we want to append these two lines into this file:
    </p>
    <pre>
        <code class="plaintext">
    ignore_lcd=0
    lcd_rotate=2
        </code>
    </pre>
    <p class="paragraph">
        By turning "ignore_lcd" off we are telling the kernel to look for an LCD display from the Display Serial Interface (DSI).
        The other one "lcd_rotate" will rotate the display 180&#176;. I needed this because I installed the legs for my stand upside down :).
        You might have different need for rotating the display and this is how it's done.
    </p>
</p>

<h3 id="wlan" class="header in-between">Setting up Wireless Networking</h3>

<p class="paragraph">
    Now we can put in the SD-card and boot up the thing and update the software catalogs and upgrade all packages. After first login with username
    <code>ubuntu</code> and the default password <code>ubuntu</code> you are prompted for a password change. Once this step is complete
    you can start installing new software. The ubuntu user is in sudoers group by default, so you should be able to run super-user commands by
    providing your own password when prompted.

    <pre>
        <code class="bash">
    sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade
        </code>
    </pre>

    <p class="paragraph">
        Then install the needed dependencies
    </p>
    <pre>
        <code class="bash">
    sudo apt-get install -y wireless-tools wpasupplicant
        </code>
    </pre>

    <p class="paragraph">
        After this we can enable the wireless interface, which should be wlan0 by default, at least with Raspberry Pi 3 Model B.
    </p>

    <pre>
        <code class="bash">
    sudo ifconfig wlan0 up
        </code>
    </pre>

    <p class="paragraph">
        In case you don't already know, or don't remember the SSID for your wireless network, you can run a scan to see what SSID's are being broadcasted.
        Note that if you're using Model B, like I am, it only supports 2.4GHz wlan band so your 5GHz band is no good here. If you need to connect to a 5GHz
        band, you need Model B+ or A+. A tip: If you are forced to work with only the Pi + Touchsreen display and can't scroll the terminal output, you can
        pipe the output of iwlist into tools like less to read it and have the ability to scroll.
    </p>

    <pre>
        <code class="bash">
    sudo iwlist wlan0 scan | less
        </code>
    </pre>

    <p class="paragraph">
        Ubuntu 18.04 is using <a href="https://netplan.io/" target="_blank">Netplan: The network configuration abstraction renderer</a> for its networking.
        Let's go and configure that for our wireless network.
    </p>

    <pre>
        <code class="bash">
    sudo nano -w /etc/netplan/50-cloud.init.yaml
        </code>
    </pre>

    <p class="paragraph">
        It should look something like this
    </p>

    <pre>
        <code class="yaml">
    network:
        version: 2
        ethernets:
            eth0:
                dhcp4: true
                match:
                    macaddress: b8:27:eb:47:a7:7e
                set-name: eth0
        </code>
    </pre>

    <p class="paragraph">
        Now let's add our wireless confguration to this file
    </p>

    <pre>
        <code class="yaml">
    network:
        version: 2
        renderer: networkd
        ethernets:
            eth0:
                optional: true
                dhcp4: true
                match:
                    macaddress: b8:27:eb:47:a7:7e
                set-name: eth0
        wifis:
            wlan0:
                optional: true
                dhcp4: true
                access-points:
                    "Network SSID":
                        password: "Network Password"
        </code>
    </pre>

    <p class="paragraph">
        The wifis configuration is really pretty straightforward. We also add a couple of more things in there. We add <code>renderer: networkd</code>,
        because the internet said so, not actually sure if it's needed or not, but there it is. Then in order to get rid of the boot-time cloud-init waiting
        for network interfaces we add <code>optional: true</code> to both interfaces and that speeds up the boot signifigantly. If you're already reaching
        the limits of your IPv4 entropy, you can add <code>dhcp6: true</code> where applicable.
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph">
        Now we can generate and apply our configuration. You can use the <code>--debug</code> flag to have more verbose output in case any error should emerge
        YAML is picky about indetations being correct, so it might be helpful
    </p>

    <pre>
        <code class="bash">
    sudo netplan --debug generate
        </code>
    </pre>

    <p class="paragraph">
        If everything looks good we can go and apply the new settings
    </p>

    <pre>
        <code class="bash">
    sudo netplan apply
        </code>
    </pre>

    <p class="paragraph">
        Finally we reboot and see whether our configuration was correct or not
    </p>

    <pre>
        <code class="bash">
    reboot
        </code>
    </pre>


</p>

<h3 id="xwindow" class="header in-between">X Window System</h3>

<p class="paragraph">
    We can now go ahead and install X Window System as the image provided is a server installation and
    doesn't provide one by default.
</p>

<p class="paragraph">

    Let's go and install X Server and <strong>Fluxbox</strong>. If the only reason to run X Window System is for Electron, we might as well choose
    a very lightweight flavour. Hence, Fluxbox is a good choice for the hardware that we are using so that we leave as much of the resources available
    to the software we really want to keep running. In this case the Electron app.

    <pre>
        <code class="bash">
    sudo apt-get install -y xserver-xorg fluxbox xterm
        </code>
    </pre>

    <p class="paragraph">
        After the installation is ready, we can testrun the X environment.
    </p>

    <pre>
        <code class="bash">
    startx
        </code>
    </pre>

    <p class="paragraph">
        To save some time during testing things out it might be a good idea to start X straight after login. We can edit our profile and add the command
    </p>

    <pre>
        <code class="bash">
    nano -w ~/.profile
        </code>
    </pre>

    <p class="paragraph">
        Append the following to the end of the file and save
    </p>


    <pre>
        <code class="plaintext">
    if [[ ! $DISPLAY && $XDG_VTNR -eq 1 ]]; then
      exec startx
    fi
        </code>
    </pre>

    <p class="paragraph">
        In order to finalize this there are multiple ways of starting things automatically including logging in, but we are going to leave that out
        from this exercise. This will speed up things a bit already.
    </p>

</p>

<h3 id="docker" class="header in-between">Installing Docker</h3>

<p class="paragraph">
    What we are still missing is <a href="https://www.docker.com/" target="_blank">Docker</a>. I followed
    <a href="https://www.containerstack.io/installing-docker-on-arm64/" target="_blank">these</a> instructions from ContainerStack.io.

    <p class="paragraph">
        Again, first some dependencies and the tools we're going to use
    </p>

    <pre>
        <code class="bash">
    sudo apt-get install -y \
        apt-transport-https \
        ca-certificates \
        curl \
        gnupg2 \
        software-properties-common
        </code>
    </pre>

    <p class="paragraph">
        Then first, add the GPG signing key for Docker
    </p>

    <pre>
        <code class="bash">
    curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/debian/gpg | sudo apt-key add -
        </code>
    </pre>

    <p class="paragraph">
        After this we can add the repository
    </p>


    <pre>
        <code class="bash">
    echo "deb [arch=arm64] https://download.docker.com/linux/debian \
        $(lsb_release -cs) stable" | \
        sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list
        </code>
    </pre>

    <p class="paragraph">
        Now we can update the software catalogs and go ahead and install docker runtime
    </p>

    <pre>
        <code class="bash">
    sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y docker-ce
        </code>
    </pre>

    <p class="paragraph">
        If everything went smoothly you should be able to verify the installed version. At the time of writing, it was
    </p>

    <pre>
        <code class="bash">
    docker --version
    Docker version 18.09.3, build 774a1f4
        </code>
    </pre>

</p>

<h3 id="packaging" class="header in-between">Packaging the application</h3>

<p class="paragraph">
    Finally the last piece of the puzzle is our application. Now, I'm going to assume that this is the real reason you are here and
    that you already have your Electron application ready to go. If not, I think that there are plenty of very good resources out there
    to go and scour.

    <p class="paragraph">
        Let's start from our package.json, which will already reveal us something about the magic that is about to happen
    </p>

    <pre>
        <code class="json">
    {
        "name": "my-application",
        "version": "1.2.3",
        "description": "My Application",
        "main": "app/index.js",
        "scripts": {
            "start": "node_modules/.bin/electron .",
            "build": "node_modules/.bin/electron-packager . my-application --platform linux --arch arm64 --out dist/",
            "debarm64": "node_modules/.bin/electron-installer-debian --src /usr/src/my-application/dist/my-application-linux-arm64/ --dest dist/installers/ --arch arm64"
        },
        "author": "Your Name &lt;your@name.com&gt;",
        "license": "UNLICENSED",
        "devDependencies": {
            "electron-installer-debian": "^1.1.1",
            "electron-packager": "^13.1.1",
            "electron": "^4.0.6"
        }
    }
        </code>
    </pre>

    <p class="paragraph">
        For making the build environment more portable, we are going to be building our application with two-stage Docker build. This is our Dockerfile
    </p>

    <pre>
        <code class="json">
    FROM arm64v8/debian:buster as builder

    # Install other apt deps

    RUN dpkg -i my-application_${MY_APPLICATION_VERSION}_arm64.deb

    CMD ["my-application"]

        </code>
    </pre>

    <p class="paragraph">
        In the first build stage, we are using arm64v8 version of debian buster as a baseimage, build our application and package that to a
        <code>.deb</code>. In the second stage, we can only install dependencies that are required running the package on an X Window System and
        not to worry about the dependencies of the application as it's already packaged as a self-containing Electron executable. So now we can just
        copy our package from the builder stage using <code>--from=builder</code> install the application and run it with <code>CMD</code>.
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph">
        Now we can build the application
    </p>

    <pre>
        <code class="bash">
    docker build -t your-context/my-application:1.2.3 .
        </code>

    <p class="paragraph">
        And then published

    <pre>
        <code class="bash">
    docker publish your-context/my-application:1.2.3
        </code>
    </pre>
</p>


<h3 id="running" class="header in-between">Running the application</h3>

<p class="paragraph">
    Now we are ready to run our application! The only thing we need to do is to tell our application on which display to render itself and give
    information how to authorize itself to the X Window System. So here is how to finally run it. After we have logged in and Fluxbox
    has started, we can hit <code>ALT+F2</code> in order to get the RUN -dialog. Type in <code>xterm</code> and hit <code>ENTER</code>. Now, in terminal
    we can run the container like this

    <pre>
        <code class="bash">
    sudo docker run --net=host --env="DISPLAY" --volume="$HOME/.Xauthority:/root/.Xauthority:rw" \
        your-context/my-application:1.2.3
        </code>
    </pre>

    <p class="paragraph">
        Your application should now be running in your Fluxbox inside a Docker container, on arm64 Ubuntu in Raspberry Pi 3 Model B.
